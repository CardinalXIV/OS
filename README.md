The scope of this assignment for question 2 is to conduct a literature review revolving the topic of Real Time Operating Systems also known as RTOS. In this report the key features that will be mentioned consist of the processes on how to build the Linux Kernel on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with the PREEMPT_RT patch to convert a typical General-Purpose Operating System (GPOS) to simulate it into an RTOS architecture. Following it will also mention how this architecture performs for various types of tasks such as the Hard, Soft and Firm Real Time Tasks. 
To figure out how the implementation fairs against its peers, a performance analysis will also be conducted to compare the results attained against other accredited research papers for other types of RTOS Architectures. To ensure integrity in the data collection and results, the following exercises used to test will be implemented as close to the tasks mentioned in other research papers as well to ensure reliable and credible comparisons. Additionally, it will be compared against a series of performance metrics to provide more insight into the performance.
